## Description

**Phylogenetic Biology** offers a modern, model-centered introduction to phylogenetic methods that places simulation and intuitive understanding at the foundation of inference. 

Unlike traditional approaches to teaching phylogenetics that introduce models in the context of looking backward in time, this textbook builds understanding by first exploring how evolutionary models generate data moving forward through time. This makes complex concepts like the General Time Reversible (GTR) model, maximum likelihood inference, and Bayesian MCMC sampling more accessible and intuitive.

The book covers essential topics including:

- Phylogenies and tree representation
- Models of molecular evolution and simulation
- Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods
- Model selection and evaluation
- Bootstrap and posterior probability support
- Analysis of morphological and continuous trait data
- Time calibration

This builds a solid understanding of core essentials that will prepare readers who go on to other topics, including comparative phylogenetic methods, species tree methods (that consider processes such as gene duplication and incomplete lineage sorting), and population genetics.

Designed for self-directed learners, undergraduate courses, graduate courses, the text emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation. Extensive use of R code examples and real phylogenetic datasets grounds abstract concepts in applied contexts. Each chapter includes worked examples, visualizations, and connections to current phylogenetic software.

Written for Yale's Phylogenetic Biology course (EEB354), this textbook serves students and researchers seeking a rigorous yet accessible introduction to modern phylogenetic methods. Readers will gain both conceptual understanding and practical skills.
