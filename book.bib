    abstract = "{Significant transition/transversion mutation bias is a well-appreciated aspect of mammalian nuclear genomes; however, patterns of bias among genes within a genome and among species remain largely uncharacterized. Understanding these patterns is important for understanding similarities and differences in mutational patterns among genomes and genomic regions. Therefore, we have conducted an analysis of 7,587 pairs of sequences of 4,347 mammalian protein-coding genes from seven species (human, mouse, rat, cow, sheep, pig, and macaque) and from the introns of 51 gene pairs and multiple intergenic regions (37 kbp, 52 kbp and 65 kbp) from the human, chimpanzee, and baboon genomes. Our analyses show that genes and regions with widely varying base composition exhibit uniformity of transition mutation rate both within and among mammalian lineages, as long as the transitional mutations caused by CpG hypermutability are excluded. The estimates show no relationship to potential intrachromosomal or interchromosomal effects. This uniformity points to similarity in point mutation processes in genomic regions with substantially different GC-content biases.}",

abstract = {The application of maximum likelihood techniques to the estimation of evolutionary trees from nucleic acid sequence data is discussed. A computationally feasible method for finding such maximum likelihood estimates is developed, and a computer program is available. This method has advantages over the traditional parsimony algorithms, which can give misleading results if rates of evolution differ in different lineages. It also allows the testing of hypotheses about the constancy of evolutionary rates by likelihood ratio tests, and gives rough indication of the error of ;the estimate of the tree.},
