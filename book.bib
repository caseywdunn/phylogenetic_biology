Most empirical evolutionary data studies contain a visualization of the inferred tree with branch support values. Ambiguous semantics in tree file formats can lead to erroneous tree visualizations and therefore to incorrect interpretations of phylogenetic analyses. Here, we discuss problems that arise when displaying branch values on trees after rerooting. Branch values are typically stored as node labels in the widely-used Newick tree format. However, such values are attributes of branches. Storing them as node labels can therefore yield errors when rerooting trees. This depends on the mostly implicit semantics that tools deploy to interpret node labels. We reviewed ten tree viewers and ten bioinformatics toolkits that can display and reroot trees. We found that 14 out of 20 of these tools do not permit users to select the semantics of node labels. Thus, unaware users might obtain incorrect results when rooting trees. We illustrate such incorrect mappings for several test cases and real examples taken from the literature. This review has already led to improvements in eight tools. We suggest tools should provide options that explicitly force users to define the semantics of node labels.}",

Understanding these patterns is important for understanding similarities and differences in mutational patterns among genomes and genomic regions. Therefore, we have conducted an analysis of 7,587 pairs of sequences of 4,347 mammalian protein-coding genes from seven species (human, mouse, rat, cow, sheep, pig, and macaque) and from the introns of 51 gene pairs and multiple intergenic regions (37 kbp, 52 kbp and 65 kbp) from the human, chimpanzee, and baboon genomes. Our analyses show that genes and regions with widely varying base composition exhibit uniformity of transition mutation rate both within and among mammalian lineages, as long as the transitional mutations caused by CpG hypermutability are excluded. The estimates show no relationship to potential intrachromosomal or interchromosomal effects. This uniformity points to similarity in point mutation processes in genomic regions with substantially different GC-content biases.}",

    abstract = {An approximately unbiased (AU) test that uses a newly devised multiscale bootstrap technique was developed for general hypothesis testing of regions in an attempt to reduce test bias. It was applied to maximum-likelihood tree selection for obtaining the confidence set of trees. The AU test is based on the theory of Efron et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:13429â€“13434; 1996), but the new method provides higher-order accuracy yet simpler implementation. The AU test, like the Shimodairaâ€“Hasegawa (SH) test, adjusts the selection bias overlooked in the standard use of the bootstrap probability and Kishinoâ€“Hasegawa tests. The selection bias comes from comparing many trees at the same time and often leads to overconfidence in the wrong trees. The SH test, though safe to use, may exhibit another type of bias such that it appears conservative. Here I show that the AU test is less biased than other methods in typical cases of tree selection. These points are illustrated in a simulation study as well as in the analysis of mammalian mitochondrial protein sequences. The theoretical argument provides a simple formula that covers the bootstrap probability test, the Kishinoâ€“Hasegawa test, the AU test, and the Zharkikhâ€“Li test. A practical suggestion is provided as to which test should be used under particular circumstances.},

By far the most commonly used is the Kishino-Hasegawa test. However, the assumptions that have to be made to ensure the validity of the Kishinoâ€“Hasegawa test place important restrictions on its applicability. In particular, it is only valid when the topologies being compared are specified a priori. Unfortunately, this means that the Kishino-Hasegawa test may be severely biased in many cases in which it is now commonly used: for example, in any case in which one of the competing topologies has been selected for testing because it is the maximum likelihood topology for the data set at hand. We review the theory of the Kishino-Hasegawa test and contend that for the majority of popular applications this test should not be used. Previously published results from invalid applications of the Kishinoâ€“Hasegawa test should be treated extremely cautiously, and future applications should use appropriate alternative tests instead. We review such alternative tests, both nonparametric and parametric, and give two examples which illustrate the importance of our contentions.},

We investigate tree-testing performance in the presence of severe selection bias. The SH test is found to be very conservative and, surprisingly, its uncorrected analog, the KH test has low Type I error even in the presence of extreme selection bias, leading to a recommendation that the SH test be abandoned. A chi-square test is found to usually behave well and but to require correction in extreme cases. We show how topology testing procedures can be used to get support values for splits and compare the likelihood-based support values to the approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) support values. We find that the aLRT support values are reasonable even in settings with severe selection bias that they were not designed for. We also show how they can be used to construct tests of topologies and, in doing so, point out a multiple comparisons issue that should be considered when looking at support values for splits.},

    abstract = {IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org, last accessed February 6, 2020) is a user-friendly and widely used software package for phylogenetic inference using maximum likelihood. Since the release of version 1 in 2014, we have continuously expanded IQ-TREE to integrate a plethora of new models of sequence evolution and efficient computational approaches of phylogenetic inference to deal with genomic data. Here, we describe notable features of IQ-TREE version 2 and highlight the key advantages over other software.},
