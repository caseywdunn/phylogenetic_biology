# Preface {-}

I developed this book as a collection of the concepts, methods, and applications that I most wanted to share with students in my Phylogenetic Biology courses. It is really my lecture notes dessed up in the form of the rough draft of a book.

## Source code

The source code for this manuscript is available on [github]( https://github.com/caseywdunn/phylogenetic_biology). The book was rendered from the source with `bookdown` [@bookdown2016].

Please submit any errors you find, typos, or suggestions that you have for improving the manuscript to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/caseywdunn/phylogenetic_biology/issues).

## Other resources

The following sites have a wide variety of material that is relevant to the 
theory and and practice of phylogenetic biology.

- An extensive list of tools, tutorials, and examples of phylogenetic tools in 
the programming language R maintained by Briam O'Meara:
[CRAN Task View: Phylogenetics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Phylogenetics.html)

- The Workshop on Molecular Evolution at Woods Hole. This is an intensive summer 
course on phylogenetics, with an emphasis on building phylogenetic trees. Check 
out the faculty pages for lecture pdfs:
[Workshop on Molecular Evolution](https://molevolworkshop.github.io)

- The Applied Phylogenetics Workshop in Bodega Bay. This is another summer course 
on phylogenetics, but with a bit more emphasis on using phylogenies to test 
evolutionary questions:
